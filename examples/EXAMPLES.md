# Examples

## The EnvRunner

The EnvRunner is a simple way to automatically create AOgmaNeo systems for [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) tasks. It will automatically create the hierarchy and appropriate pre-encoders, by guessing reasonable settings. This is good enough for initial experimentation, but further control requires manual usage. Image-based environments require [tinyscaler](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/TinyScaler) in order to scale images to appropriate sizes.

## CartPole examples

The CartPole examples are simple tests on the Gym CartPole environment. The Manual one sets up a hierarchy manually, while the EnvRunner one does it automatically using EnvRunner.

## WaveLinePrediction example

The WaveLinePrediction example shows how to use a SPH for prediction of a simple waveform. Requires matplotlib.

## LunarLander example

The LunarLander example shows a slightly more complicated reinforcement learning environment using EnvRunner. The Gym LunarLander environment features a landing module that the agent must maneuver to the landing pad.
